This project is based on an alternate version of the Tower of Hanoi but with only two towers instead of three.
It made me sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types
of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.
You can find more details on the project and its restriction on the Push_Swap Subject.
